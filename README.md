## Welcome to Filer
![](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp/blob/main/intro.png)
Filer is an Finder extension for your Mac which enables you to easily create files in supported formats anywhere on the system. The main reason for developing this extension is that my girlfriend complained a while ago why the MacBook Air doesn't have a Windows-like right-click to create a new document. So the idea of simply writing an extension for her was born. This extension is simple and easy to use, completely free and no in-app purchases, no ads, hope you like it.

### System Requirements
Filer only supports macOS with system version equal to or higher than 11.0.

### Install
The easiest way to install the extension is to tap [Download Zip File](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp/releases/download/v1.0/Filer.app.zip) button. The first time you open Filer, macOS may tell you that the software needs to be update. Just ignore it, and go to **System preferences**, open **Security & Privacy**, and choose open Filer.

> **Note**
> 
> If you can't find **New file** selection after opening Filer, you may need to enable this feature manually. Just go to **System preferences**, and open **Extensions**, on **Added Extensions**, select Filer.
