## Welcome to Filer
![](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp/blob/main/intro.png)
Filer is a Finder extension for your Mac which enables you to easily create files in supported formats anywhere on the system. This extension is simple and easy to use, completely free and no in-app purchases, no ads, hope you like it.

The main reason for developing this extension is that my girlfriend complained a while ago why the MacBook Air doesn't have a Windows-like right-click function to create a new document anywhere. So the idea of simply developing an extension for her was born.

### System Requirements
Filer only supports macOS with system version equal to or higher than 11.0.

### Install
The easiest way to install the extension is to tap [Download Zip File](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp/releases/download/v1.0/Filer.app.zip) button. The first time you open Filer, macOS may tell you that the software needs to be update. Just ignore it, and go to **System preferences**, open **Security & Privacy**, and choose open Filer.

When you open Filer, there is no app icon on the dock and a small icon will appear on the menu bar in the upper right corner, and you can [view extension help](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp) or exit the extension.

> **Note**
> 
> If you can't find **New file** selection after opening Filer, you may need to enable this feature manually. Just go to **System preferences**, and open **Extensions**, on **Added Extensions**, select Filer.
