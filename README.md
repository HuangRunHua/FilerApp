> Filer is now only available on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/filerapp/id1626627609?l=en&mt=12) and feature updates will only available on the Mac App Store. But you can still download former version [here](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp).

Filer is a Finder extension for your Mac which enables you to easily create files in supported formats anywhere on the system. Hope you like it.

The main reason for developing this extension is that my girlfriend complained a while ago why the MacBook Air doesn't have a Windows-like right-click function to create a new document anywhere. So the idea of simply developing an extension for her was born.

### System Requirements
Filer only supports macOS with system version equal to or higher than 11.0.

### Install
The easiest way to install the extension is to download [Filer](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/filerapp/id1626627609?l=en&mt=12) on the Mac App Store.

When you open Filer, there is no app icon on the dock and a small icon will appear on the menu bar in the upper right corner where you can view extension [help](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/FilerApp/blob/main/guide.md) or exit the extension.

> **Note**
> 
> If you can't find **New file** selection after opening Filer, you may need to enable this feature manually. Just go to **System preferences**, and open **Extensions**, on **Added Extensions**, select Filer.
