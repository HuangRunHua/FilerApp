# Tutorial of Using Filer
> **Important**
>
> Before installing Filer, please ensure your macOS version is equal or higher than 11.0.

## Enable Folder Access
After you downloading Filer on the Mac App Store and open it, you need to enable Filer to access your user folder so that you can create documents in your disk.

Open Filer **Preference** by tapping the menu bar selection which shows in the following picture:

When you tap the **Preference** selection, you will see the preference view shows in the following picture:

Read the text in the preference view carefully and then tap the **Allow Folder Access** button.

When you tap the **Allow Folder Access** button you will see a window appears which represent your user folder, please tap **Confirm Access** button to allow Filer access your folder. All sub-folders will be accessible by Filer immediately so that you don not need to authorize Filer to access every folder every time.

> **NOTING**
>
> You can also allow Filer to access folders you want it to access. Just select a different folder and tap **Confirm Access**.

Due to the macOS system, you can not create a new file in the following paths even if you authorize Filer to do so.
-  `/Library/` and its sub-folders
- `/System/` and its sub-folders
- ` /Applications/` and its sub-folders

Only folders that under your user folder can create a new file.

> **WARNING**
>
> If you change Filer to access another Folder, due to the macOS system, the former folder can still be accessed by Filer until you quit Filer and Filer extension.

After you authorize Filer to access your folder, you can see the allowed folder path just appears on the bottom of Preference view.

### Enable Filer Extension
Due to Apple's request, all app extensions will not enable unless user enables them in the System Preferences. So you need to enable Filer extension yourself.

go to **System preferences**, open **Extensions**.
